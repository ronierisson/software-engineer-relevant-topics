## Data Structures

<details>
<summary>What Are Data Structures?</summary>
<br>
The elementary particles of algorithms, data structures are woven into the very fabric of computer science and are essential building blocks of many a solution to coding interview problems.

Sans the need for a microscope.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Complexity Analysis</summary>
<br>
Two dimensions, time and space, diverged in a yellow wood, and I—
I watched the Complexity Analysis video on AlgoExpert,
And that has made all the difference (in my coding interviews).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Memory</summary>
<br>
The bedrock of all data structures, memory is the underlying concept that you absolutely need to know in order to understand why data structures work the way they do.

Bits and bytes may keep me up all night,
But memory will never ail me!
</details>

<details>
<summary>Big O Notation</summary>
<br>
The speed and memory usage of an algorithm aren't necessarily fixed; they might change depending on the input. So how do we express the performance of an algorithm then?

Enter Big O Notation, a powerful tool that allows us to generalize the space-time complexity of an algorithm as a function of its input size.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Logarithm</summary>
<br>
That scary-looking word you know you should understand but just really...don’t? Yeah, that one. It’s time to make it your best friend.

Warning: a logarithmless way of life will seem inconceivable after watching this video.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Arrays</summary>
<br>
Perhaps the most classic and most commonly used of all data structures, the array is deceptively simple. Key word: "deceptively."

Don’t be fooled! Where it might appear trivially straightforward at surface level, it actually boasts an array—pun intended—of nuances worthy of taking a second gander
</details>

<details>
<summary>Linked Lists</summary>
<br>
The data structure whose singular purpose in life is to be reversed. Even right here on AlgoExpert, in fact.

That’s right, head on over to the hard questions list after watching this video, and reverse that bad boy every which way to Sunday.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hash Tables</summary>
<br>
Fun. Fast. Flexible. This beloved data structure is a fan favorite among interviewers and interviewees alike, and for good reason: it lends itself extremely well to any problem requiring some sort of lookup operation, of which (spoiler alert) there are many.

Watch out for those collisions though!
</details>

<details>
<summary>Stacks And Queues</summary>
<br>
Push. Pop. FIFO. LIFO. That pretty much sums up stacks and queues.

Ok, there might be a bit more to them than meets the eye. Watch our video to find out. Plus, it even features nifty stick figures!
</details>

<details>
<summary>Strings</summary>
<br>
Not a standalone data structure per se, strings are generally considered to be a data type that behaves like a data structure.

Nonetheless, they do possess a few interesting characteristics that earn them a dedicated video here in our course. Let’s dive in!
</details>

<details>
<summary>Graphs</summary>
<br>
These collections of edges and vertices might look as banal as a child's scribble on a restaurant table, but they're of fundamental importance in discrete mathematics. The eponymous field of "graph theory" is dedicated to their study, and their importance in mathematics carries over to computer science.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Trees</summary>
<br>
A special type of graph, trees excel at storing data hierarchically and are commonly used as a means of testing your knowledge of recursion during coding interviews.

Interesting fact: unlike their botanical counterparts, these digital perennials sport but a single, unique root.
</details>

## Systems Design Fundamentals
<details>
<summary>Client—Server Model</summary>
<br>
A client is a thing that talks to servers. A server is a thing that talks to clients. The client—server model is a thing made up of a bunch of clients and servers talking to one another.

And that, kids, is how the Internet works!
</details>

<details>
<summary>Network Protocols</summary>
<br>
IP packets. TCP headers. HTTP requests.

As daunting as they may seem, these low-level networking concepts are essential to understanding how machines in a system communicate with one another. And as we all know, proper communication is key for thriving relationships!
</details>

<details>
<summary>Storage</summary>
<br>
An entire video dedicated just to the storage of data?

Yes! Multiple videos, in fact, as you'll see later on when we discuss databases. As it turns out, information storage is an incredibly complex topic that is of vital importance to systems design. 
Don't even think of skipping this lesson!
</details>

<details>
<summary>Latency And Throughput</summary>
<br>
If you've ever experienced lag in a video game, it was most likely due to a combination of high latency and low throughput. And lag sucks.

It is therefore your Call of Duty to master these two concepts and to join the crusade against high ping.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Availability</summary>
<br>
Oops! This content is unavailable right now. Please try again later.




Just kidding! SystemsExpert is a highly available system.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Caching</summary>
<br>
What do a punching bag and a cache have in common?

    

    
They can both take a hit!  (ง ͠° ل͜ ͡°)ง
</details>

<details>
<summary>Proxies</summary>
<br>
Often used by nefarious hackers to conceal their identity and obfuscate their location, these special intermediary servers boast many important real-life applications within the context of caching, access control, and censorship bypassing, amongst other things.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Load Balancers</summary>
<br>
Relentlessly distributing network requests across multiple servers, these digital traffic cops act as watchful guardians for your system, ensuring that it operates at peak performance day and night.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hashing</summary>
<br>
Hashing? Like from hash tables? Should be simple enough, right?

The good news is that, yes, hashing like from hash tables.

The bad news is that, no, not simple enough. The video duration and thumbnail should be ominously indicative.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Relational Databases</summary>
<br>
Tables and ACID.

No, we're not describing a drug lord's desk, but rather referring to key properties of relational databases. There's a lot of material to cover here, so hit the play button, kick back, and get ready to store tons of knowledge in the biggest database of them all: your brain.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Key-Value Stores</summary>
<br>
One of the most commonly used NoSQL paradigms today, the key-value store bases its data model on the associative array data type.

The result? A fast, flexible storage machine that resembles a hash table. That's right folks, our favorite friendly neighborhood data structure strikes again!
</details>

<details>
<summary>Specialized Storage Paradigms</summary>
<br>
Yup. This is another video about storage.

Nope. This isn't the last video about storage.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Replication And Sharding</summary>
<br>
A system's performance is often only as good as its database's; optimize the latter, and watch as the former improves in tandem!

On that note, in this video we'll examine how data redundancy and data partitioning techniques can be used to enhance a system's fault tolerance, throughput, and overall reliability.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Leader Election</summary>
<br>
Citizens in a society typically elect a leader by voting for their preferred candidate. But how do servers in a distributed system choose a master node? Via algorithms of course!

This form of algorithmic democracy is known as "leader election", though we personally think "algorithmocracy" sounds way cooler.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Peer-To-Peer Networks</summary>
<br>
Equality for all.
Sharing is caring.
Unity makes strength.
The more the merrier.
Teamwork makes the dream work.
Welcome to peer-to-peer networks!
</details>

<details>
<summary>Polling And Streaming</summary>
<br>
You can think of polling and streaming kind of like a classroom; sometimes students ask the teacher lots of questions, and other times they quiet down and listen attentively to the teacher's lecture.

Now fire up the video and get ready to stream; you won't be able to poll here. Class is in session!
</details>

<details>
<summary>Configuration</summary>
<br>
The config file is like the genome of a computer application; it stores parameters that define your system's critical settings, much like your DNA stores the genes that define your physical characteristics.

Unlike its biological counterpart though, the config file is easily editable. No gene therapy needed!
</details>

<details>
<summary>Rate Limiting</summary>
<br>
*Poke*
*Poke*
*Poke*
*Po——*

Too many pokes! You just got rate limited.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Logging And Monitoring</summary>
<br>
In order to properly understand and diagnose issues that crop up within a system, it’s critical to have mechanisms in place that create audit trails of various events that occur within said system.

So go ahead, unleash your inner Orwell and go full Big Brother on your application.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Publish/Subscribe Pattern</summary>
<br>
Publish/Subscribe. Press/Tug. Produce/Consume. Push/Pull. Send/Receive. Throw/Catch. Thrust/Retrieve.

Three of these can be used interchangeably in the context of systems design. The others cannot.
</details>

<details>
<summary>MapReduce</summary>
<br>
"MapReduce is a programming model for processing and generating big data sets with a parallel, distributed algorithm on a cluster."

Does Wikipedia's nebulous definition confuse you? Of course it does. In this video, we'll map out this complex topic and reduce it to clear, easily-understood concepts. See what we did there?  ( ͡~ ͜ʖ ͡°)
</details>

<details>
<summary>Security And HTTPS</summary>
<br>
While network security is of critical importance to virtually any system, it's beyond the scope of most system design interviews.

That being said, having even a cursory understanding of a few key concepts could very well materialize into the edge you need to ace your interview and secure—pun perhaps intended—a job offer.
</details>

<details>
<summary>API Design</summary>
<br>
So you've mastered all lessons hitherto on SystemsExpert, and you now feel confident you could ace any systems design interview. That's wonderful and all, but...could you pass an API design interview?

If you're sweating bullets, then sweat no more. This final video is the last piece of the puzzle you need to become a true Systems Expert.
</details>


## Machine Learning

<details>
<summary>Naive Bayes</summary>
<br>
In the real world, naive baes are young, inexperienced lovers.

In the machine-learning world, naive bayes are probabilistic classification algorithms based on Baye's theorem.

Potayto, potahto.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Performance</summary>
<br>
Is your model any good? Is it an improvement over your heuristic? How do you even measure and quantify this? 

In this video, we'll be going over techniques you can use to evaluate and tune your model's performance in order to ensure it boasts...model performance.  ( ͡~ ͜ʖ ͡°)
</details>

<details>
<summary>Naive Bayes Optimizations</summary>
<br>
Another section on Naive Bayes? 

Yes! As it turns out, there is more to this model than meets the eye. So stick around, and you'll see why it isn't as naive as it might have originally seemed.
</details>

<details>
<summary>K Nearest Neighbors</summary>
<br>
"You are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with." 

While this statement might sound a bit reductive, if not slightly offensive, the truth is that, in practice, proximity does in fact often entail similarity, as Ryan will demonstrate in this video.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Decision Trees</summary>
<br>
Yes or no? That is the question.


    

Literally.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Linear Regression</summary>
<br>
You know that topic the professor spent half the semester talking about in your intro college stats class, but that you never really paid attention to? Yes, you know the one. 

Well, friend, it's time to make it your best friend, because it certainly is a good friend of our machine overlords friends.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Logistic Regression</summary>
<br>
Where linear regression is used to predict outputs that can take on an infinite number of values, logistic regression instead aims to solve problems where the number of outcomes are limited.

And much like its cousin, this supervised-learning technique boasts a high level of popularity in machine-learning circles.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Support Vector Machine</summary>
<br>
Why do support vectors always look sad?




Because they feel marginalized.
</details>

<details>
<summary>K-means</summary>
<br>
Centroid. Metroid. Medoid.

Two of these refer to a cluster's center in the context of clustering algorithms. The other refers to a parasitic, life-draining alien jellyfish.

Can you guess which is which?
</details>

<details>
<summary>Singular Value Decomposition</summary>
<br>
As you've probably noticed, we like to keep these blurbs light and cheeky. Unfortunately, despite our best attempts, we simply could not find humor in "singular value decomposition." So here's a cute ASCII bear instead:  

ʕ •ᴥ•ʔ
</details>

<details>
<summary>Neural Networks</summary>
<br>
You might be thinking that artificial neural networks are this scary, complex topic. And you'd be absolutely correct.

Fortunately, you're equipped with the most powerful neural network of them all, which should allow you to successfully navigate this section on deep learning. You've got this!
</details>

<details>
<summary>Convolutional Neural Networks</summary>
<br>
Convolutional, but not necessarily convoluted.



Don't you love our witty epigrams?
</details>

<details>
<summary>Recurrent Neural Networks</summary>
<br>
Here
Here we
Here we cover
Here we cover RNNs [EOS]
</details>

<details>
<summary>Generative Adversarial Neural Networks</summary>
<br>
Generator: "I promise this is a real Rolex."
Discriminator: "No, it's definitely not."
Generator: "What if I change the position of the hands slightly and then promise it's real again?"
Discriminator: "I'll almost certainly believe you then."
</details>

<details>
<summary>Collaborative and Content Based Filtering</summary>
<br>
Teamwork makes the dream work!

A timeless adage that applies to every aspect of life, be it sports, academia, relationships, and yes, even machine-learning systems.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Learning To Rank</summary>
<br>
Rank your top five ML models.


Did you use a ranking model to rank your models?

## Large-Scale Machine Learning

<details>
<summary>Data Ingestion</summary>
<br>
In order to do anything with a machine-learning system, you first need to feed it some inputs. In this first video of the series, we'll look at technologies you can use to ingest data into your systems and review some considerations you can make throughout this process.

Let's dive in!
</details>

<details>
<summary>Data Storage</summary>
<br>
If you've gone through our Systems Design Fundamental series, then you know how important having a high-performing storage model is to any system.

And guess what? Massive, computationally-intense ML systems are certainly no exception!
</details>

<details>
<summary>Data Processing</summary>
<br>
Ingesting and storing data into your system is great, but without a robust processing engine in place to extract features and labels from that data, you won't get very far.

Fortunately, as is often the case in the software engineering world, Apache comes in clutch with some nifty solutions to our woes.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Processing Orchestration</summary>
<br>
In the previous video, we looked at how you might go about manually processing data. This obviously isn't scalable, so the next step is to remove the human element and fully automate the process.

Luckily, and perhaps unsurprisingly, we can once again turn to Apache to help us accomplish this goal!
</details>

<details>
<summary>Workspaces</summary>
<br>
With your data-support pipeline in place, the final missing piece of the puzzle is setting up an organized workspace from which you can explore all of your model combinations and ultimately manage every single bit—pun absolutely intended—of data.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Frequentist AB Testing</summary>
<br>
A: Here, we'll introduce A/B testing—from the frequently used frequentist perspective.

B: Here, we'll cover frequentist A/B testing—don't tell the Bayesians!
</details>

<details>
<summary>Bayesian AB Testing</summary>
<br>
Using your prior knowledge, there's a strong likelihood that you'll see the benefits of using Bayesian A/B tests over frequentist A/B tests. 

If not, you can always A/B test them.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Multi-Armed Bandit</summary>
<br>
hile the multi-armed bandit we'll be covering here isn't a kraken plundering gold from pirate ships (that would be pretty cool), the idea of a monstrous cephalopod pillaging vessels is a surprisingly decent metaphor for this alternative to A/B testing!
</details>

<details>
<summary>Impact Estimation</summary>
<br>
In business, money talks. So if you want your super-duper cool ML projects to be given the greenlight in a business setting, you need to prove that they will yield some financial value to the company.

This video is full of tips to ensure you emerge from this series not only as an MLExpert, but also as a ProfitExpert!
</details>

<details>
<summary>Basic Models</summary>
<br>
In the Machine Learning Crash Course, we looked at a number of basic machine-learning models you can use, but we did so from a simplified, theoretical point of view.

It's time to revisit some of these models and explore how we can alter them to work in a large, enterprise-level data setting.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Deep Learning Models</summary>
<br>
Just like in the previous video, we're going to put the practical in the academic and take a deeper—pun, as usual, intended—look at deep-learning models.

Fire up that play button!
</details>

<details>
<summary>Model Validation</summary>
<br>
The hyperparameter tuning process of complex, business-grade ML models can often cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, so it is imperative to optimize this process in a way that minimizes its cost.

Remember, you cannot be a true MLExpert without also being a seasoned ProfitExpert!
</details>

<details>
<summary>Productionization</summary>
<br>
Transitioning your model from the experimentation phase to a live production environment is the final step! A lot of time, money, and resources have been invested at this point, so it's critical to reduce the human-error element as much as possible to ensure a smooth and successful launch.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Data Hosting</summary>
<br>
Production environments have stricter performance requirements than testing environments, especially with regards to latency; after all, you're serving real users, so every millisecond is precious!

In this video, we'll look at how we can leverage in-memory databases and distributed caching to crush latency and keep users happy.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Model Hosting</summary>
<br>
You've made it to the finish line! In this final video of the Large-Scale Machine-Learning series, we'll continue down the hosting-optimization rabbit hole we previously dove into.

A true MLExpert isn't satisfied until they've eradicated all traces of latency from their systems, even when serving millions of users!
</details>
